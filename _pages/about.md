I am currently a first-year Master's student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Honggang Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/honggangchen/). Previously, I had the honor of visiting the [Visual Intelligence & Perception Lab (VIP Lab)](https://zhengfenglab.com/) at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), led by [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&go=1&iscss=1&snapid=1&lang=en), and also gained valuable experience at the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), under the guidance of [Siteng Huang](https://kyonhuang.top/).


:pushpin: Please find my current publication list on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9VhMC1QAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and my research interests can be summarized as follows:
* **Vision-language Learning**: visual grounding (VG) and [referring video object segmentation (R-VOS)](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Awesome-Video-Object-Segmentation).
* **Transfer Learning**: [parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL)](https://github.com/synbol/Awesome-Parameter-Efficient-Transfer-Learning) and zero-shot learning (ZSL).
* **Generative Models**: text-to-image generaction (Text2Image) and text-to-video generaction (Text2Video).

:raised_hands: Please feel free to reach out to me at [this email](liuxuyang@stu.scu.edu.cn), if you are interested in collaborating with me.
